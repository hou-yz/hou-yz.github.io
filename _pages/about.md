About
======
Yunzhong Hou (侯云钟) is a PhD student in Computer Science at Australian National University. Currently, he works under the supervision of [Dr. Liang Zheng](http://zheng-lab.cecs.anu.edu.au/) and [Prof. Stephen Gould](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/). 
Before that, he received his bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University in 2018. 
He currently servers as a conference reviewer for CVPR, ICCV, ACM MM, IJCAI; and a journal reviewer for IEEE TPAMI, TIP, TMM, TCSVT.

His current research interest lies in computer vision and deep learning. More specifically, it includes semi-supervised learning, semantic segmentation, multiview detection and tracking, domain adaptation, and generative models.
